The data from this project will be used by the Red Cross to assist in forecasting future disaster impacts, by knowing in advance what is likely to be impacted and its exposure and vulnerability. The information will help implementation of early action activities to take place before a disaster strikes, contributing to reduce risk, prepare for effective response and ultimately to strengthen community resilience.
