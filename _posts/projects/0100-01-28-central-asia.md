Central Asia is a region which is especially prone to natural disasters. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are not just situated in an area of high seismic activity but are also more and more under stress due to the effects of climate change. German Red Cross is conducting projects using anticipatory humanitarian assistance â€“ here on the basis of forecast information, e.g. for extreme weather events such as cold and heat waves, early action is taken to minimise the impacts of those events.
