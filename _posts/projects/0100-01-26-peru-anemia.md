We are working with the ministry of health in Velille Peru, using Kobo Collect to understand reasons for high anemia and malnutrition amongst children. This involves field level surveys identifying what drinking sources people are using (e.g. drinking from the river), whether people have access to sanitation services, and whether they are supported by the government anemia programs.
