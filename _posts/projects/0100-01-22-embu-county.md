MSF is supporting health centres in Embu County in Kenya to develop a model of care for Non Communicable Diseases such as diabetes or epilepsy. In order to have a good understanding of the area of interest of the project, it would be valuable to have a high detailed map of the county. This map will help the team to know the accessibility to the health facilities as well as their catchment area.
