MSF is working in Bouna and Moissala in Chad since 2010 to support primary health care and prevention. This MapSwipe project will help MSF in the understanding of where all villages in the Bouna and Moissala health districts are. This will help in in carrying out geo-point sampling procedures for community surveys and a better programming of health activities.
