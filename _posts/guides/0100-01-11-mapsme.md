## Using Maps.Me to navigate and add places to Openstreetmap in your community

Download Maps.Me from the PlayStore or App Store on your phone. Search for a place you know well and you will be prompted to download the surrounding area. Itâ€™s worth doing this when you have good connectivity. You can then use it entirely off-line.
